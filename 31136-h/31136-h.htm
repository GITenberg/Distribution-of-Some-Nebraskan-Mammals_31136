<h2>Distribution of Some Nebraskan Mammals</h2>

<p class="center">by<br /><br />

J. Knox Jones, Jr.</p>


<p>Because military service will interrupt my study of Nebraskan
mammals, I am here placing on record certain information on the
geographic distribution of several species&mdash;information that is
thought pertinent to current studies of some of my associates. Most
of this information is provided by specimens recently collected by
me and other representatives of the University of Kansas Museum
of Natural History, although specimens from other collections provide
some of the records herein reported. The other collections are
the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum
(USBS), the Hastings Museum (HM), the Nebraska Game,
Forestation and Parks Commission (NGFPC), the University of
California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), the University
of Michigan Museum of Zoology (MZ) and the University of Nebraska
State Museum (NSM). Grateful acknowledgment hereby
is made to persons in charge of these several collections for lending
the materials concerned. Specimens mentioned in the following accounts
are in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History,
except as otherwise stated. All measurements are in millimeters.
Color terms are those of Ridgway (1912). A part of the funds for
field work was made available by the National Science Foundation
and the Kansas University Endowment Association.</p>

<p><b>Sorex cinereus haydeni.</b> (Baird). <span class="smcap">Cinereous Shrew.</span>&mdash;Two male
shrews were trapped on April 7, 1952, among rocks along an old
railroad fill, 4 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E of Octavia, Butler County, thus extending
the known geographic range of <i>S. c. haydeni</i> approximately 60
miles southward from a line connecting Perch, Rock County, Nebraska,
with Wall Lake, Sac County, Iowa (see Jackson, 1928:52-53),
and providing the first record of occurrence in the Platte River Valley.
Two additional specimens, taken on July 17, 1952, are from
2-1/2 mi. N of Ord, Valley County, along the Loup River, a tributary
of the Platte from the north.</p>

<p><b>Blarina brevicauda carolinensis</b> (Bachman). <span class="smcap">Short-tailed
Shrew.</span>&mdash;J. S. Findley and I, in a forthcoming paper, review the distribution
of <i>Blarina brevicauda</i> in the Great Plains region, recording
<i>B. b. carolinensis</i> from the extreme southeastern and southwestern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
counties of Nebraska. A series of five shrews of this species recently
obtained from three miles south and two miles east of
Nebraska City in Otoe County, average significantly smaller in both
the cranial and the external measurements than typical <i>B. b. brevicauda</i>
and fall well within the range of <i>carolinensis</i>. Average and extreme
external measurements of the four adults from Otoe County,
three males and one female, are as follows: Total length, 110 (109-112);
length of tail-vertebrae, 24.2 (22-26); length of hind foot, 13.8
(13-14). Another specimen from 3 mi. S, 1-1/2 mi. E of Peru, Nemaha
County, also is referable to <i>carolinensis</i>. These recent records indicate
that the range of <i>B. b. carolinensis</i> extends up the Missouri
River Valley, approximately to Nebraska City, Otoe County. Five
specimens from Louisville, Cass County, the next county northward,
along the River, are referable to <i>B. b. brevicauda</i>.</p>

<p><b>Eptesicus fuscus fuscus.</b> (Beauvois). <span class="smcap">Big Brown Bat.</span>&mdash;One big
brown bat was obtained on July 23, 1952, from one mile west of
Niobrara, Knox County. While not so dark in dorsal coloration as
some specimens of <i>E. f. fuscus</i> from eastern Nebraska (Cass and
Sarpy counties), this specimen is noticeably darker than a series of
<i>E. f. pallidus</i> from Ft. Niobrara Wildlife Refuge, 4 mi. E of Valentine,
Cherry County, being near (16" <i>j</i>) Snuff Brown as opposed to
near (16' <i>i</i>) Buckthorn Brown. Previous to the taking of this specimen,
Webb and Jones (1952:277) reported as <i>E. f. pallidus</i> a specimen,
saved as a skull only, which was picked up dead at Niobrara.
It seems best to assign these two bats from the vicinity of Niobrara,
Knox County, to <i>E. f. fuscus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Sciurus carolinensis carolinensis</b> Gmelin. <span class="smcap">Gray Squirrel.</span>&mdash;An
adult male gray squirrel shot by Mr. Terry A. Vaughan in the
heavily timbered bluffs of the Missouri River, 3 mi. S, 2 mi. E of
Nebraska City, Otoe County, on October 10, 1953, provides the only
museum specimen of a gray squirrel from Nebraska known to me.
Residents in the area concerned report small numbers of this squirrel
as still occurring on the heavily wooded bluffs along the Missouri
River in Nemaha, Otoe and Richardson counties, Nebraska,
at least as far north as Nebraska City.</p>

<p>Gray squirrels from Nebraska have been reported twice before in
the literature as follows: "Mouth of Platte [River]" (Baird, 1858:262)
and Barada, Richardson County (Jones and Webb, 1949:312).
Swenk (1908:80), while listing no actual records, says of this squirrel,
"Common in the timber along watercourses of southeastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
Nebraska, but greatly outnumbered everywhere by [<i>Sciurus niger</i>]
<i>rufiventer</i>. I have no records west of the 97th meridian nor north
of the Platte."</p>

<p><b>Spermophilus franklinii</b> (Sabine). <span class="smcap">Franklin Ground Squirrel.</span>&mdash;A
specimen from 2 mi. NW of Lisco, in Morrill County (NSM
3324), extends the known geographic range of <i>S. franklinii</i> approximately
200 miles westward along the Platte River Valley from
Kearney, Buffalo County (see Howell, 1938:134), and suggests a
westward movement of this ground squirrel along the Platte River
in recent years.</p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavescens flavescens</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Plains Pocket
Mouse.</span>&mdash;<i>P. f. flavescens</i> occurs in the Sand Hills and adjacent
mixed-grass plains of central Nebraska. Eastern marginal records
of occurrence are: Neligh, Antelope County, 2 (MVZ 1, NSM 1);
1 mi. E of Ravenna, Buffalo County, 2 (MZ); unspecified locality
in Adams County, 1 (HM).</p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavescens perniger</b> Osgood. <span class="smcap">Plains Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;This
mouse occurs in northeastern Nebraska. Osgood (1904:127),
in the original description of the subspecies, listed two specimens
from Verdigris [Verdigre], Knox County. Additional records of
occurrence are: Beemer, Cuming County, 2 (USBS); 1-1/2 mi. SE of
Niobrara, Knox County, 3; 1-1/2 mi. S of Pilger, Stanton County, 2.</p>

<p>The two specimens from Beemer are typical <i>perniger</i>. All of the
other Nebraskan specimens are intergrades between <i>P. f. flavescens</i>,
geographically adjacent to the west, and <i>P. f. perniger</i> to the east but
are best referred to <i>perniger</i> on the basis of greater total length,
larger cranial measurements and darker dorsal coloration.</p>

<p><i>P. f. perniger</i> was originally described (Osgood, <i>op. cit.</i>) on the
basis of its darker dorsal coloration and encroachment of the lateral
line on the posterior parts of the venter. The latter character is
not present in all Nebraskan specimens. Mice from the two localities
in Knox County have buffy underparts; those from other
Nebraskan localities do not. Of nine specimens of <i>P. f. perniger</i>
examined from Elk River, Sherburne County, Minnesota, none has
buffy underparts whereas a specimen from Randolph, Fremont
County, Iowa (NSM) does. In addition, in two of five specimens
of <i>P. f. flavescens</i> from Kelso, Hooker County, (MZ) the lateral line
encroaches on the underparts. The encroachment of the lateral line
on the underparts, or failure of the line to do so, is thought to be
only an individual variation and of no taxonomic use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavus piperi</b> Goldman. <span class="smcap">Buffy Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;In
the description of <i>P. f. bunkeri</i>, Cockrum (1951:206) allocated to
the new subspecies, without comment, a specimen from Alliance,
Box Butte County. I have examined this specimen along with all
other Nebraskan specimens known to me and, although all approach
<i>bunkeri</i> in cranial measurements, they seem best referred to <i>piperi</i>
on the basis of darker dorsal coloration and larger external measurements.
Additional records of occurrence, several of them marginal
to the eastward, are: 10 mi. S of Antioch, Garden County, 1 (MZ);
Kelso, Hooker County, 4 (MZ); 5 mi. N of Bridgeport, Morrill
County, 1 (MVZ); 6 mi. N of Mitchell, Scotts Bluff County, 1
(NSM). A specimen not seen by me that was reported from Valentine,
Cherry County (Beed, 1936:21), is presumably also best referred
to <i>P. f. piperi</i>.</p>

<p>No specimens of <i>P. flavus</i> are known to me from south of the
Platte River in southwestern Nebraska although they probably occur
there. If so, they may be referable to <i>P. f. bunkeri</i>, which is found
in counties of Kansas adjoining the southwestern part of Nebraska.</p>

<p><b>Perognathus hispidus paradoxus</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Hispid Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;This
subspecies occurs commonly in central-and western-Nebraska.
Eastern marginal records of occurrence are: 2 mi. SE of
Niobrara, Knox County, 1 (NGFPC); 4 mi. E, 2 mi. S of Ord, 1;
Bladen, Webster County, 2 (HM).</p>

<p><b>Perognathus hispidus spilotus</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Hispid Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;Jones
and Webb (1949:312) first reported this subspecies in Nebraska
as from 5 mi. SE of Rulo, Richardson County. Additional
records of occurrence are: 3 mi. SW of Barnston, Gage County, 1
(NGFPC); Bennet, 1 (NSM), 9 mi. NW of Lincoln, 1 (NSM), 1-1/2
mi. S of Lincoln, 1 (NSM), Lancaster County; Peru, Nemaha
County, 1 (NGFPC); 3 mi. S, 2 mi. E of Nebraska City, Otoe
County, 3; Barada, Richardson County, 1 (NSM); Pleasant Dale,
Seward County, 1 (NSM); 1 mi. S of Williams, Thayer County, 1.</p>

<p>Glass (1947:179) referred a specimen from 9 mi. NW of Lincoln,
Lancaster County, to <i>P. h. paradoxus</i>. In discussing the zone of
intergradation between <i>spilotus</i> and <i>paradoxus</i>, geographically adjacent
to the west, he wrote (<i>op. cit.</i>:178), "It is evident that it proceeds
northeastwards, toward the Missouri River since 2 specimens
from eastern Nebraska, a juvenile from Webster County and an
adult from Lancaster County, are both typical <i>paradoxus</i>." I have
examined the specimen from Webster County referred to by Glass
and agree that it is <i>paradoxus</i>. I have not seen the specimen from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
9 mi. NW of Lincoln; however, another specimen from there, two
others from Lancaster County, and one from Seward County (see
above), are here referred to <i>P. h. spilotus</i>, rather than <i>P. h. paradoxus</i>,
on the basis of notably darker dorsal coloration and smaller
external and cranial measurements. The range of <i>P. h. spilotus</i> in
Nebraska, as presently known, therefore, is limited to the eastern,
more humid part of the State, south of the Platte River.</p>

<p><b>Peromyscus maniculatus osgoodi</b> Mearns. <span class="smcap">Deer Mouse.</span>&mdash;Swenk
(1908:95) reported this subspecies, under the name <i>Peromyscus
nebrascensis</i>, from Glen, and Dice (1941:17) reported the subspecies
from Agate, both localities being in Sioux County in the northwestern
part of the State. Osgood (1909), however, did not mention
Nebraskan specimens of this subspecies and excluded it from the
State on his (<i>op. cit.</i>) distribution map of the subspecies of <i>P.
maniculatus</i>. In addition, Quay (1948:181) reports, as <i>P. m. nebrascensis</i>,
deer mice obtained by him in the badlands of northern
Sioux County and adjacent Niobrara County, Wyoming. Four deer
mice referable to <i>P. m. osgoodi</i> have been obtained from several
localities on the Pine Ridge in Dawes County as follows: 3 mi. E
of Chadron, 2; Chadron State Park, 1; 3 mi. SW of Crawford, 1.
When compared with specimens of <i>P. m. nebrascensis</i>, geographically
adjacent to the east, these mice are seen to be notably darker
and less buffy than <i>nebrascensis</i> and to average significantly larger in
both external and cranial measurements. All deer mice from the
Pine Ridge and adjacent badlands of extreme northwestern Nebraska
probably are best referred to <i>P. m. osgoodi</i>. External measurements
of two adult females are respectively: Total length, 180,
175; length of tail-vertebrae, 78, 74; length of hind foot, 19, 20;
length of ear, 17, 16.</p>

<p><b>Neotoma floridana campestris</b> J. A. Allen. <span class="smcap">Florida Wood Rat.</span>&mdash;Five
wood rats from 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County, in
extreme southwestern Nebraska, provide the first record of occurrence
of this subspecies in Nebraska. These animals were trapped
in outlying sheds at the Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery. Two
large wood-rat houses were in a dense thicket of brush and young
trees in a small draw on the west side of the most westwardly
hatchery lake. Brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) inhabited a combination
garage-storage barn at the hatchery and no wood rats were
taken there.</p>

<p><b>Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus</b> (Ord). <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania
Meadow Mouse.</span>&mdash;This subspecies occurs in eastern and central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
Nebraska (see Bailey, 1900:18 and Swenk, 1908:104). Additional
records of occurrence are as follows: 5 mi. E of Rising City, Butler
County, 5; 4 mi. SE of Laurel, Cedar County, 1; Wayne, 2, and 2-1/2
mi. E of Wayne, 1, Wayne County; 2-1/2 mi. N of Ord, Valley County, 4.</p>

<p><b>Synaptomys cooperi gossii</b> (Coues). <span class="smcap">Cooper Lemming Mouse.</span>&mdash;Fichter
and Hanson (1947:1-8) reported the first known occurrence
of this microtine in Nebraska, recording specimens from several
localities in Lancaster County and one from near Valentine,
Cherry County. Recent records of this mouse which help to clarify
its distribution in Nebraska are as follows: 4 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E of
Octavia, Butler County, 1; 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County,
1; 1 mi. N of Pleasant Dale, Seward County, 1.</p>

<p>An adult female from Dundy County provides the westernmost
record of distribution of the species in North America. The animal
was trapped on November 1, 1952, in association with <i>Microtus
pennsylvanicus modestus</i> in a marshy area at the Rock Creek State
Fish Hatchery on spring-fed Rock Creek. The pelage on the back
is notably darker than in <i>S. c. gossii</i>, and resembles <i>S. c. paludis</i>
from the Cimarron River drainage in Meade County, Kansas, but
in the sum total of its characters it most closely resembles <i>S. c.
gossii</i> among named subspecies.</p>

<p><b>Mustela rixosa campestris</b> Jackson. <span class="smcap">Least Weasel.</span>&mdash;The least
weasel occurs in eastern and central Nebraska (see Swenk, 1926:313-330
and Hall, 1951:192) but is known by only a single specimen
from each locality of record save for the area around Inland, Clay
County (Swenk, <i>op. cit.</i>). Additional records of the distribution of
this mustelid in Nebraska are: Hastings, Adams County, 1 (HM);
Schuyler, Colfax County, 1 (NGFPC); Goehner, Seward County, 1
(NSM); 10 mi. S of Ord, Valley County, 1 (NGFPC). The last
mentioned specimen, a skull only, was obtained from a pellet of an
unidentified raptorial bird.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
